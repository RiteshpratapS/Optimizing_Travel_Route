# Optimizing_Travel_Route
*Project goal* The goal of this project is to optimize travel routes for a delivery vehicle by using machine learning. This is a two-component problem: first, Train a model on the data to predict how long it will take a delivery vehicle to go from point one point to another, and feed these predictions to a genetic algorithm which decides the most time efficient visit order for a given set of points.
